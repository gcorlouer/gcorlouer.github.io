Hi, I'm Guillaume.

Currently, I am a researcher interested in applying multivariate information theory to deep neural networks for AI interpretability.

Previously, I was a research affiliate at the Principle of Intelligence and Behavior in Biological and Social systems (PIBBSS), where I worked on [singular learning theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JDrxA3vwZAKZfmShz/degeneracies-are-sticky-for-sgd) and explored the application of information theory for [lie detection in LLMs](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=0QCJiNgAAAAJ&citation_for_view=0QCJiNgAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC).

I have also conducted [AI strategy research](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ne8ZS6iJJp7EpzztP/the-optimal-timing-of-spending-on-agi-safety-work-why-we) in collaboration with the Center on Long Term Risk.

My [PhD thesis](https://sussex.figshare.com/articles/thesis/Investigating_information_transfer_in_ECoG_time_series_during_visual_perception_Parametric_multivariate_Granger_causality_estimation_methods_and_applications_to_a_hierarchy_of_visually_responsive_ECoG_channels_in_humans_viewing_pictures/24347092?file=42759271), completed under the supervision of Lionel Barnett and Anil Seth at the University of Sussex, focused on estimating information flow between different brain regions during visual perception.

I enjoy teaching and have worked as a teaching assistant at the african institute for mathematical sciences ([AIMS](https://aims-senegal.org/)) in Sénégal for ten months.

Outside of my areas of expertise, I have a keen interest in the fields of moral and political philosophy, as well as economics.
