Hi I'm Guillaume.

Currently I am a researcher working on multivariate information theory for the interpretability of deep neural networks.

Before that I was a research affiliate at the principle of intelligence and behavior in biological and social systems (PIBBSS) working on [singular learning theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JDrxA3vwZAKZfmShz/degeneracies-are-sticky-for-sgd) and using information theory for [lie detection in LLMs](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=0QCJiNgAAAAJ&citation_for_view=0QCJiNgAAAAJ:7PzlFSSx8tAC).

I also have done some [AI strategy research](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ne8ZS6iJJp7EpzztP/the-optimal-timing-of-spending-on-agi-safety-work-why-we) working with Tristan Cook and Nicolas Mac√© with the Center on Long Term Risk.

I wrote my [PhD thesis](https://sussex.figshare.com/articles/thesis/Investigating_information_transfer_in_ECoG_time_series_during_visual_perception_Parametric_multivariate_Granger_causality_estimation_methods_and_applications_to_a_hierarchy_of_visually_responsive_ECoG_channels_in_humans_viewing_pictures/24347092?file=42759271) with Lionel Barnett and Anil Seth at the University of Sussex on estimating information flow between different regions of the brain during visual perception.
